                <h2>What is it?</h2>
               <p>Haven't heard of Reproducitve Justice? GOOD, i'll be happy to explain it to you. Reproducitve Justice is having the complete right to choose what you want to do with your body and how you want to live. It's having the power to control your body and mind. Because it's all yours! So, don't forget that. </p>
    <p> Some examples if you're still confused:
     <p> - Decidng how or when you want children.</p>
     <p> - Controlling what happens to your body.</p>
     <p> - Having sexuality options.</p>
     <p> - Choosing a gender fit for you.</p>
                
            </div>
        
             <div class="section3">
                 <h2>!YOUR body, YOUR choice!</h2>
               
              <p>No one can tell you what you want to do with 
 your body or tell you how think. It's important that we all remember that no one can control what you do with your body. So, take note of your right and fight for it.   </p>
